	* slide-show-winie.css: Opens next slide by double-click (not
	single-click).

	* slide-xbl.xml: Makes slideshow default (rather than slidelist),
	since Firefox 1.0 has no control for style sheets without extension
	package.
	
	* ChangeLog: New file.

	* *.htc: Merged into *-winie.css as "expression".
